# WeatherWatcher
Takes data from OpenWeather and sends it to console. Python script.

If you're reading this through your computer's file editor, congrats! You have just downloaded your weather watcher for maybe the next decade or two.
If you're reading this on GitHub, please download the file.

NOTICE!!!! Dev note: This will only work if you change "city" at the very top to your city's name. Otherwise it will print the weather somewhere completely different....
